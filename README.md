## General Information
We are working for Lending club a finance company which has various types of loans to urban customers. 

When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s financial data. 

As mentioned in the case study there are two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision:

- If the applicant is to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company
- If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company

The credit loss is the amount of money lost by the lender when the borrower refuses to pay or runs away with the money owed. Perform an analysis to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default.

We have analyzed the casestudy to provide a better solution for lending club so that in future the company shouldn't get loss any amount from their customers at any point of time. The aim is to identify patterns which indicate if a person is likely to default, which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc.
